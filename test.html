    My prior writings on the Least Resistance Philosophy may provide strategies for engaging in action by virtue of
    conducting preparation.

    In short, the least resistance philosophy is to “mold your life so that the path of least resistance is the path of
    maximum productivity,” which relates to long-term behavior change with two of its principles:

    Reduce transaction costs to engaging in productive behavior.

    Erect transaction costs to engaging in counter-productive behavior.

    For example, if you want to eat fewer snacks, put them in the pantry instead of on the counter.

    Or put them in a safe that you have to unlock each time.

    Or don’t even buy them in the first place, so that eating a snack now means going to the store.

    In general, scouring your environment for temptations and muting or eliminating them will help you mute or eliminate
    undesired behavior.
